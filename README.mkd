Configuration files
===================

Nothing spectacular here. Just some configuration files I use for work. These
include:

 + Complete Vim configuration geared towards JavaScript development
 + Reference nginx virtual server with SSL and redirect from HHTP to HTTPS
 + MongoDB configuration file for deploying as normal user

Note about paths
----------------

Keep in mind that some paths in the configuration files may need to be
modified. Best to grep the whole directory for `/home/foxbunny` and change that
to whatever fits your situation.

What's in vimfiles
------------------

The vimfiles contain a whole bunch of plugins and configuration options, but
notably:

 + Leader character is comma `,`
 + NerdTree is opened with `,~`
 + GUndo (graphical undo) is opened with `,u`
 + FuzzyFinder opens with `,o` (replace current buffer) or `C-T` (new tab)
 + Fugitive is included by default
 + When quitting, session is saved in `~/.vim_sessions/default.vim`
 + Default session can be restored with `,ss` at any time
 + `Fgrep` command can be used to grep current directory for keywords
 + `Space2Tab` and `Tab2Space` commands are available (they do what you think
   they do)
 + `,Backspace` will remove trailing spaces
 + A few JavaScript snippets specific to the way I work are available
 + JSLint runs automatically in the background and checks syntax (requires 
   Node.js)
 + `F8` and `F9` can be used to switch spelling on and off respectively
 + Pathogen is installed for better organization of plugins
 + ...
